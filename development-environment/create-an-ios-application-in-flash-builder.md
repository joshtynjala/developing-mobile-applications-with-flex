# Create an iOS application in Flash Builder

Here is a general workflow for creating a mobile application for the Apple iOS
platform.

1.  Before you begin creating the application, ensure that you follow the steps
    at
    [Apple iOS development process using Flash Builder](./apple-ios-development-process-using-flash-builder.md).

2.  In Flash Builder, select File \> New \> Flex Mobile Project.

    Select the target platform as Apple iOS, and set the mobile project
    settings.

    Follow the prompts in the new-project wizard as you would for any other
    project-building wizard in Flash Builder. For more information, see
    [Create an application](./create-an-android-application-in-flash-builder.md#create-an-application).

    You can also create an ActionScript-only mobile project. For more
    information, see
    [Create ActionScript mobile projects](https://web.archive.org/web/20150403072419mp_/http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flashbuilder/using/WSc5cd04c102ae3e972ff2927b12e1411968f-7ff6.html).

3.  Configure launch configurations to run and debug the application. You can
    run or debug the application on the desktop or on a connected device.

    For more information, see
    [Debug an application on an Apple iOS device](../test-and-debug/test-and-debug-a-mobile-application-on-a-device.md#debug-an-application-on-an-apple-ios-device).

4.  Export the application to the Apple App Store or deploy the iOS package
    application (IPA) on a device.

    For more information, see
    [Export Apple iOS packages for release](../package-and-export/export-apple-ios-packages-for-release.md)
    and
    [Install an application on an Apple iOS device](../install-on-devices/install-an-application-on-an-apple-ios-device.md).
