# Create an ActionScript mobile project

Use Flash Builder to create an ActionScript mobile application. The application
that you create is based on the Adobe AIR API.

1.  Select File \> New \> ActionScript Mobile Project.

2.  Enter a project name and location. The default location is the current
    workspace.

3.  Use the default Flex 4.6 SDK that supports mobile application development.

    Click Next.

4.  Select the target platforms for your application, and specify mobile project
    settings for each platform.

    For more information on mobile project settings, see
    [Set mobile project preferences](./set-mobile-project-preferences.md).

5.  Click Finish, or click Next to specify additional configuration options and
    build paths.
