## Create an application

Here is a general workflow to create applications for the BlackBerry Tablet OS.

1.  Before you begin creating the mobile application, install the BlackBerry
    Tablet OS SDK for AIR from the
    [BlackBerry Tablet OS Application Development site](https://web.archive.org/web/20150530174325mp_/http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/adobe.jsp).

    The BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for AIR provides APIs that let you create
    AIR-based Flex and ActionScript applications.

    For more information on installing the BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK, see the
    [BlackBerry Tablet OS Getting Started Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20150530174325mp_/http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/adobe.jsp).

2.  To create a Flex-based AIR application, in Flash Builder, select File \>
    New \> Flex Mobile Project.

    Follow the prompts in the new project wizard as you would for any other AIR
    project in Flash Builder. Ensure that you select BlackBerry Tablet OS as the
    target platform.

    For more information, see
    [Flex mobile projects](https://web.archive.org/web/20150530174325mp_/http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flashbuilder/using/WSc5cd04c102ae3e972ff2927b12e1411968f-7ff8.html)

3.  To create an ActionScript-based AIR application, in Flash Builder, select
    File \> New \> ActionScript Mobile Project.

    Follow the prompts in the new project wizard as you would for any other AIR
    project in Flash Builder. Ensure that you select BlackBerry Tablet OS as the
    target platform.

    For more information, see
    [Create ActionScript mobile projects](https://web.archive.org/web/20150530174325mp_/http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flashbuilder/using/WSc5cd04c102ae3e972ff2927b12e1411968f-7ff6.html).

## Sign, package, and deploy an application

For information on signing, packaging, and deploying the application, see the
[BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR Development Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20150530174325mp_/http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/23959/)
by RIM.

You can find several additional resources for BlackBerry Tablet OS development
from both Adobe and RIM at
[Adobe Developer Connection](https://web.archive.org/web/20150530174325mp_/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/blackberry.html).
